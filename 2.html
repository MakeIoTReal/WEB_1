<h2> CSS이란 무엇인가> </h2>
<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets , or Cascading Style Sheets
  ( Cascading Style Sheets , CSS) is a markup language,
   a language that describes how the actual display [1]
    , HTML and XHTML mainly used in, XML can be used in
    . It is a W3C standard and has a high degree of free
    dom in defining layout and style.
If the markup language (ex. HTML) is responsible for t
he body of the website, CSS can be said to serve as a de
coration for clothes and accessories. In other words, you c
an decorate it like any other website by changing the CSS file
 without changing the HTML structure.

In the case of CSS3, which is currently under development , t
he ability to replace images produced by graphic editing progr
ams such as shadow effects, gradients, and transformations has be
en added. Also, various animation functions have been added to rep
lace Adobe Flash to some extent.
